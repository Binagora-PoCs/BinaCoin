# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# Setup
1. Follow instructions on https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview in order to configure hardhat.
2. install open zeppelin contracts https://docs.openzeppelin.com/ running npm install "@openzeppelin/contracts".
